/// Swift's built in Dictionary and Array types are value typesâ€”meaning that when they're modified,
/// their reference is fully replaced with a new copy of the structure. Because updating instance
/// variables on Swift objects is not atomic, they aren't thread-safe. So if we have the dictionary
/// being updated from two different threads in our app, they both may attempt to write at the same
/// block of memory. This can lead to memory corruption and other race conditions which are hard to debug.
///
/// The trick to making it thread safe is to use a private isolation key within our data structure that
/// limits reads during writes. This is more commonly called a reader-writer lock, and can be implemented
/// in various ways. Using Grand Central Dispatch, the recipe is simple. Concurrent, synchronous reads,
/// and serial, asynchronous writes.
///
/// Queues can be used as a synchronization mechanism in place of
/// more traditional locking constructs like `p_thread_lock` or `NSLock`. This way, we get parallelism (
/// (returns control to caller right away), safety (impossible to forget to unlock), and control (custom
/// queues, queue priority etc).
