 # Authenticating Data with HMAC
 
 Use a message authentication code (MAC) to authenticate data with symmetric key cryptography.
 For example, to verify that you’re authorized to upload a file to a server, the server might require you
 to attach a MAC created using a key that your app shares with the server.
 This tells the server that you uploaded the data, and that it remains unaltered from the time that you created the MAC.

 Create a random symmetric key. The sender and the receiver must share this key.

 If you receive a MAC, you can verify it without initializing a HashedAuthenticationCode.

/*:
 In order to protect against timing attacks, the comparison of a MAC with Data does not leak
 the shared prefix between the computed value and the value to be verified.

 You can use any CryptoKit HashFunction, or type conforming to the HashFunction protocol, to generate an HMAC.
