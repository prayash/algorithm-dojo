 # Performing Common Cryptographic Operations
     
 You can hash, authenticate, and encrypt data with symmetric key cryptography.
 These operations are fast and efficient, but require the parties to share a secret key.
 When a shared key isn’t available, you can use public-key cryptography to create one,
 or to sign and encrypt data directly.
