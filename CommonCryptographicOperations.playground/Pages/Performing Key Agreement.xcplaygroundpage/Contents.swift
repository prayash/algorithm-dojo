 # Performing Key Agreement
 
 Use key agreement to establish a shared secret between two parties, each with their own private keys.
 
 The shared secret that you compute with elliptic curve key agreement is not itself suitable for use as a key
 because it’s not uniformly distributed. Instead, you derive a symmetric key from the secret.
 Include a salt value specific to your use case during key derivation.
