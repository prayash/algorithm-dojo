 # Hashing Data
 
 The output of a hash function, a digest, is a small data value that is virtually unique for a given input.
 The hash function’s collision resistance measures how unlikely it is for two different inputs to result in the same digest.
 Use the hash functions in CryptoKit to produce digests with excellent collision resistance.
 For example, you can create a digest that you transmit with a file to let the receiver verify that the file is intact.
 Even a single-bit error in the file during transmission results in the receiver computing a significantly different digest than the original.
